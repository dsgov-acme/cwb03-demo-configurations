## Work left to do

This project did exactly what it needed to do with basically no issues. However, as noted in the work-manager
NYP-Handoff.md document, we do plan on moving away from the dynamic data aspect of DSGov. Having said that, this would
be the work we'd still need to do when staying with the dynamic data:

- Remove MTA prefix from all config files

Also, if moving away from the dynamic data, this application will not be needed as it's used to seed all the data
in the system that is dynamic.
